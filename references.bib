@inproceedings{Hughes2015,
   abstract = {Internationally there is a growing call for building more resilient cities and for improving the resilience of our communities and critical infrastructure. This is in response to a realisation that the services we take for granted may be robust in the face of predictable hazards, but are actually extremely fragile in the face of unanticipated shocks. But what does building resilience actually mean and entail? Flooding is a relatively predictable hazard that has the potential to affect all New Zealand towns and cities, and with the impacts of climate change becoming increasingly clear, the likelihood of major flood events (both land based, and coastal) affecting our communities and critical infrastructure is increasing. This paper looks in detail at the concept of resilience, and draws on related research to propose a framework for assessing and improving resilience to flood hazards. The framework divides resilience into a number of broad dimensions: namely community, technical and organisational, and develops a series of specific principles within each of these dimensions. The authors also discuss a range of terms related to resilience-such as risk management, vulnerability and sustainability and how they interrelate. They also emphasise how the various fields of land use planning, infrastructure planning and natural hazard planning must work more closely together to, ultimately, make our communities more resilient to flooding. A number of case studies are presented, which provide learnings from both successes and failures, in planning for and recovering from large flood events.},

@article{Logan2020,
   abstract = {We urgently need to put the concept of resilience into practice if we are to prepare our communities for climate change and exacerbated natural hazards. Yet, despite the extensive discussion surrounding community resilience, operationalizing the concept remains challenging. The dominant approaches for assessing resilience focus on either evaluating community characteristics or infrastructure functionality. While both remain useful, they have several limitations to their ability to provide actionable insight. More importantly, the current conceptualizations do not consider essential services or how access is impaired by hazards. We argue that people need access to services such as food, education, health care, and cultural amenities, in addition to water, power, sanitation, and communications, to get back some semblance of normal life. Providing equitable access to these types of services and quickly restoring that access following a disruption are paramount to community resilience. We propose a new conceptualization of community resilience that is based on access to essential services. This reframing of resilience facilitates a new measure of resilience that is spatially explicit and operational. Using two illustrative examples from the impacts of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we demonstrate how decisionmakers and planners can use this framework to visualize the effect of a hazard and quantify resilience-enhancing interventions. This “equitable access to essentials” approach to community resilience integrates with spatial planning, and will enable communities not only to “bounce back” from a disruption, but to “bound forward” and improve the resilience and quality of life for all residents.},
