### Abstract
New Zealand’s coastal settlements face escalating flood risks due to rising sea levels, increased storminess, and land subsidence. Petone, located in the Hutt Valley, is among the country’s most vulnerable communities, with dense development and critical transport infrastructure exposed to pluvial, fluvial, groundwater, and coastal inundation hazards. Traditional flood management has relied heavily on engineered defences, but such approaches are costly, inflexible, and risk maladaptation. This thesis explores the potential of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to build resilience in Petone’s transport network as a low-cost, adaptable alternative. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combines GIS-based spatial analysis of vulnerable assets, HEC-RAS flood modelling under IPCC climate scenarios, and comparative evaluation of NbS and grey infrastructure options. Stakeholder engagement with local councils, infrastructure managers, and community representatives further grounds the analysis in local governance realities. Results indicate that selected NbS typologies, when integrated into transport planning, can reduce exposure while providing wider ecological and social co-benefits. However, institutional, financial, and spatial barriers constrain their uptake. This thesis proposes a framework for integrating NbS into urban transport resilience strategies, offering pathways for equitable, cost-effective adaptation in New Zealand’s coastal cities.
