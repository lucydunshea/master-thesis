   abstract = {<p>Floods are the most common hazard in New Zealand, the second most costly and they will change rapidly in frequency and intensity, become more extreme as the impacts of climate change become realized. At the same time, we are undergoing an intense urban development and growing population lives in floodplains, increasing the risk for people&#8217;s households and wellbeing. Additionally, computers have limited power and capacity, so there is a limitation in the number of flood scenarios that can be assessed and in the complexity of the hydrodynamic modelling process. This research project, which is part of the 5-year multi-stakeholder research programme &#8220;Reducing flood inundation hazard and risk across Aotearoa/New Zealand&#8221;, supported by the New Zealand Government and led by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA); investigates the feasibility of using a hybrid hydrodynamic/machine learning model to reduce the numerical modelling load and enable probabilistic modelling. The study site is the Wairewa catchment (Little River, Canterbury, New Zealand), working closely with the Wairewa R&#363;nanga based there. A sample of flooding scenarios is constructed based on the characteristics of the main inundation driver (spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall extreme events) and other inundation drivers (lake level and antecedent conditions in the catchment). Selected scenarios from this sample will be modelled through a previously calibrated hydrodynamic model and the resultant inundation maps (maximum water depth map for each event) will be used to train a machine learning algorithm to produce the maps for the remaining events. The hybrid model would provide for any flooding scenario (defined by a specific number of variables) the corresponding inundation map in a fast and accurate way, avoiding the hydrodynamic modeling process (very time and computationally expensive). Results from this research will be used to develop a M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori approach to flood resilience and flood related policies by the local and central governments.</p>},

   abstract = {Hydrology deals with the occurrence, movement, and storage of water in the earth system. Hydrologic science comprises understanding the underlying physical and stochastic processes involved and estimating the quantity and quality of water in the various phases and stores. The study of hydrology also includes quantifying the effects of such human interventions on the natural system at watershed, river basin, regional, country, continental, and global scales. The process of water circulating from precipitation in the atmosphere falling to the ground, traveling through a river basin (or through the entire earth system), and then evaporating back to the atmosphere is known as the hydrologic cycle. This introductory chapter includes seven subjects, namely, hydroclimatology, surface water hydrology, soil hydrology, glacier hydrology, watershed and river basin modeling, risk and uncertainty analysis, and data acquisition and information systems. The emphasis is on recent developments particularly on the role that atmospheric and climatic processes play in hydrology, the advances in hydrologic modeling of watersheds, the experiences in applying statistical concepts and laws for dealing with risk and uncertainty and the challenges encountered in dealing with nonstationarity, and the use of newer technology (particularly spaceborne sensors) for detecting and estimating the various components of the hydrologic cycle such as precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration.},

   abstract = {Nuisance flooding (NF) refers to low levels of inundation that do not pose significant threats to public safety or cause major property damage, but can disrupt routine day-to-day activities, put added strain on infrastructure systems such as roadways and sewers, and cause minor property damage. NF has received some attention in the context of low-lying coastal cities exposed to increasingly higher high tides, a consequence of sea level rise, which exceeds the heights of coastal topography. However, low levels of flooding are widespread and deserve greater attention. Here a simple, quantitative definition of NF is proposed based on established flood intensity thresholds for flood consequences (e.g., pedestrian safety, property damage, and health risks). Based on a wide range of literature including hydrology, transportation, public health risk, and safety impacts, we define NF based on depth >3 cm and <10 cm, regardless of the source. This definition of NF is not limited to high tide flooding but rather is inclusive of all possible flood drivers including pluvial, fluvial, and oceanic and can capture trends in NF resulting from trends in, and compounding effects of, flood drivers. Furthermore, we also distinguish between NF as a process and NF as an event, which is important for linking NF to societal impacts and developing effective policy interventions and mitigation strategies. Potential applications and implications of NF monitoring are also presented.},

The study constructs measures of vulnerability and resilience that are independent of proposed indicators and uses regression analysis to investigate which indicators influence these measures. The analysis finds that (1) middle- and low-income homeowners are less financially resilient than are poorer renters. The recovery cost middle- to low-income homeowners 2.4 times their annual per capita incomes, while renters paid out about half of their per capita incomes. Resilience increases with income but conditional on ownership of assets that are at risk. (2) Disabled and/or chronically ill residents are more vulnerable and less resilient by many outcome measures. (3) Non-white households experience longer disruptions of access to food. (4) Information, hazard-specific capacities of community groups, and pre-hazard access to services such as food and health care are important indicators of vulnerability and resilience. (5) The evidence that other commonly proposed indicators are correlated with independent measures of vulnerability and resilience to flooding is weak. The study yields hypotheses for further research on how relevant indicators differ across hazards and contexts.},

This research examines the efficacy of flood protection systems and land use planning by comparing Amsterdam in the Netherlands (renown for resilience planning methods), with the city of Houston, Texas in the US (seeking ways of increasing resilience due to extreme recent flooding). It assesses flood risk of future urban growth in lieu of sea level rise using the Land Transformation Model, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) land use prediction tool. Findings show that Houston has currently developed much more urban area within high-risk flood-prone zones compared to Amsterdam. When comparing predicted urban areas under risk, flood-prone future urban areas in Amsterdam are also relatively smaller than Houston. Finally, the increased floodplain when accounting for sea level rise will impact existing and future urban areas in Houston, but do not increase risk significantly in Amsterdam. The results suggest that the protective infrastructure used in the Netherlands has protected its future urban growth from sea level rise more adequately than has Houston.},

Stopbanks (levees) perform a critical flood protection function in all regions of the country. However, there have been limited and inconsistent records on the location and physical attributes of these stopbanks at a national level. Through collaboration with regional government representatives, we provide the first standardised national inventory of stopbanks, the New Zealand Inventory of Stopbanks (NZIS). The NZIS provides a standardised geospatial overview of New Zealand's 5284 km long stopbank network, enabling spatial reviews and comparisons of flood protection characteristics at national and regional scales. Around 64% of New Zealand's total stopbank length is situated within five regions (Canterbury, Waikato, Southland, Manawatū-Whanganui and Bay of Plenty), while the nation's most densely population region, Auckland, accounts for just 1.9% of the total national stopbank length. Our research uses the NZIS geospatial dataset to conduct a preliminary exposure assessment of New Zealand's stopbank network to seismic and co-seismic hazards; including proximity to known active earthquake faults, ground shaking intensities and susceptibility to liquefaction and landslides. Preliminary exposure assessments provide an example of how the NZIS can be adopted and applied.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow and elongated regions of enhanced horizontal water vapour transport. Considerable research on understanding Northern Hemisphere ARs and their relationship with extreme precipitation has shown that ARs have a strong association with heavy rainfall and flooding. While there has been very little work on ARs in the Southern Hemisphere, global climatologies suggest that ARs are equally as common in both hemispheres. New Zealand in particular is located in a region of high AR frequency. This study aims to test the hypothesis that ARs play a significant role in heavy precipitation and flooding events in New Zealand. We used a recently developed AR identification method and daily station data across New Zealand to test for the concurrence of ARs and extreme rainfall. We found that, at each of the eleven stations analysed, at least seven to all ten of the top ten heaviest precipitation days between 1980 and 2018 were associated with AR conditions. Nine of the ten most damaging floods in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 occurred during AR events. These results have important implications for understanding extreme rainfall in New Zealand, and ultimately for predicting some of the most hazardous events in the region. This work also highlights that more research on ARs in New Zealand is needed.},

Examining four Aotearoa New Zealand cities, we combine historical tide-gauge extremes with geo-located property data to estimate the annual expected loss from this hazard, for each property, in order to establish when insurance retreat is likely to occur. We find that as sea level rise changes the frequency of inundation events, 99% of properties currently within 1% AEP coastal inundation zones can expect at least partial insurance retreat within a decade (with less than 10 cm of sea level rise). Our modelling predicts that full insurance retreat is likely within 20-25 years, with timing dependent on the property's elevation and distance from the coast, and less intuitively, on the tidal range in each location.},

Despite their vulnerability to flood damage, detailed exposure information on characteristics and monetary value is often unavailable for flood risk assessment. In this study we model physical and non-physical building characteristics for object-level replacement valuation in New Zealand flood hazard areas. Public data is used with geospatial and supervised learning models to estimate building characteristics. Replacement values were calculated from object-specific unit values based on useable floor area and physical and non-physical characteristics. Learning model evaluation showed higher prediction precision from a larger explanatory variable range while models learned on characteristics from all urban and rural areas transferred with higher precision. National flood hazard area exposure for 441,384 residential buildings was estimated at NZD $218 billion replacement value. Exposure comprises 282,395 houses valued at NZD $213 billion and 158,989 appurtenant buildings valued at NZD $5 billion. Spatio-temporal analyses demonstrated a high proportion of replacement value exposure occurred in five major urban areas. Building construction in flood hazard areas peaked between 1960 and 1980. Construction slowed in subsequent decades though total floor area and replacement value has continued to increase. The study demonstrates detailed information from object-level modelling is critical for understanding spatio-temporal drivers of exposure in flood risk assessments at national to local scales.},

Despite the fact that considerable research effort has been spent and progress has been made on damage data collection, data analysis and model development in recent years, there still seems to be a mismatch between the relevance of damage assessments and the quality of the available models and datasets. Often, simple approaches are used, mainly due to limitations in available data and knowledge on damage mechanisms. The results of damage assessments depend on many assumptions, e.g. the selection of spatial and temporal boundaries, and there are many pitfalls in economic evaluation, e.g. the choice between replacement costs or depreciated values. Much larger efforts are required for empirical and synthetic data collection and for providing consistent, reliable data to scientists and practitioners. A major shortcoming of damage modelling is that model validation is scarcely performed. Uncertainty analyses and thorough scrutiny of model inputs and assumptions should be mandatory for each damage model development and application, respectively. In our view, flood risk assessments are often not well balanced. Much more attention is given to the hazard assessment part, whereas damage assessment is treated as some kind of appendix within the risk analysis. Advances in flood damage assessment could trigger subsequent methodological improvements in other natural hazard areas with comparable time-space properties. © Author(s) 2010.},

   abstract = {As a vital human need, water has been absolutely critical to decisions as to where cities originate, how much they grow and the standard of living of the inhabitants. The relationship is complex however; we need both continual availability and protection from its potential impacts. Over recent decades flooding and scarcity episodes have become commonplace in even the most advanced countries - and these events cannot be disassociated from the socio-economic context within which they occur; being directly related to how we live, where we live and how we govern. This book draws together information on a host of connected subjects from population growth to water scarcity to the relationship between humanity and nature, then demonstrates how utilizing notions of risk and resilience could help improve the relationship between the city and its most precious resource. Combining discussions of risk, water and spatial planning it provides an invaluable text for planning, geography and urban studies students on how to address urban water problems within a rapidly changing world.},

   abstract = {Anticipating and managing the impacts of sea-level rise for nations astride active tectonic margins requires understanding of rates of sea surface elevation change in relation to coastal land elevation. Vertical land motion (VLM) can either exacerbate or reduce sea-level changes with impacts varying significantly along a coastline. Determining rate, pattern, and variability of VLM near coasts leads to a direct improvement of location-specific relative sea level (RSL) estimates for coastal hazard risk assessment. Here, we utilize vertical velocity field from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, calibrated with campaign and continuous Global Navigation Satellite System data, to determine the VLM for the entire coastline of New Zealand. Guided by available knowledge of the seismic cycle, the VLM data infer secular, interseismic rates of land surface deformation. Using the Framework for Assessing Changes to Sea-level (FACTS), we build probabilistic RSL projections using the same emissions scenarios employed in IPCC Assessment Report 6 and local VLM data at 8,179 sites, thereby enhancing spatial coverage that was previously limited to four tide gauges. We present ensembles of probability distributions of RSL for each scenario to 2150, and for low confidence sea-level processes to 2300. Where land subsidence is occurring at rates >2 mm/y VLM makes a significant contribution to RSL projections for all scenarios out to 2150. Our approach can be applied to similar locations across the world and has significant implications for adaptation planning, as timing of threshold exceedance for coastal inundation can be brought forward (or delayed) by decades.},

   abstract = {Internationally there is a growing call for building more resilient cities and for improving the resilience of our communities and critical infrastructure. This is in response to a realisation that the services we take for granted may be robust in the face of predictable hazards, but are actually extremely fragile in the face of unanticipated shocks. But what does building resilience actually mean and entail? Flooding is a relatively predictable hazard that has the potential to affect all New Zealand towns and cities, and with the impacts of climate change becoming increasingly clear, the likelihood of major flood events (both land based, and coastal) affecting our communities and critical infrastructure is increasing. This paper looks in detail at the concept of resilience, and draws on related research to propose a framework for assessing and improving resilience to flood hazards. The framework divides resilience into a number of broad dimensions: namely community, technical and organisational, and develops a series of specific principles within each of these dimensions. The authors also discuss a range of terms related to resilience-such as risk management, vulnerability and sustainability and how they interrelate. They also emphasise how the various fields of land use planning, infrastructure planning and natural hazard planning must work more closely together to, ultimately, make our communities more resilient to flooding. A number of case studies are presented, which provide learnings from both successes and failures, in planning for and recovering from large flood events.},

   abstract = {We urgently need to put the concept of resilience into practice if we are to prepare our communities for climate change and exacerbated natural hazards. Yet, despite the extensive discussion surrounding community resilience, operationalizing the concept remains challenging. The dominant approaches for assessing resilience focus on either evaluating community characteristics or infrastructure functionality. While both remain useful, they have several limitations to their ability to provide actionable insight. More importantly, the current conceptualizations do not consider essential services or how access is impaired by hazards. We argue that people need access to services such as food, education, health care, and cultural amenities, in addition to water, power, sanitation, and communications, to get back some semblance of normal life. Providing equitable access to these types of services and quickly restoring that access following a disruption are paramount to community resilience. We propose a new conceptualization of community resilience that is based on access to essential services. This reframing of resilience facilitates a new measure of resilience that is spatially explicit and operational. Using two illustrative examples from the impacts of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we demonstrate how decisionmakers and planners can use this framework to visualize the effect of a hazard and quantify resilience-enhancing interventions. This “equitable access to essentials” approach to community resilience integrates with spatial planning, and will enable communities not only to “bounce back” from a disruption, but to “bound forward” and improve the resilience and quality of life for all residents.},

   abstract = {Urban stormwater practitioners are frequently engaged to "Fix the flooding" in a discrete area. Being able to actually do this requires that a designer needs to know • What "the flooding" (i.e. the problem) actually is; • That a solution can be optimised for best value; • That success in achieving this goal can be measured. The word "fix" implies that something is "broken" or is in need of improvement. "Flooding" exists only in the wake of a flood event, and cannot generally be observed on a day-today basis making it difficult to study the flooding problem. Historic flood observations can indicate "problems" to be fixed, but we frequently require flood predictions that go beyond observations to fully scope the problem; and it is these predictions that imply the full flooding problem that requires "fixing". To some people, "fixing the flooding" can mean removal of any nuisance surface water (i.e. runoff that is not contained within a purpose-built network) in an event of a given or chosen level of severity. It could also mean ensuring that floodwater does not enter any buildings in a given magnitude of event, or it could mean removal of any safety hazards for a different set of events. The flood problem, and possible ways to measure success in addressing it, means different things to different people. There can be a differentiation between nuisance flooding and damaging flooding, and justifying a spend in providing relief from flooding can be somewhat qualitative. In some cases, flood reduction is seen as a success in provision of the sought relief but there remains a question on the degree of reduction (i.e. could more be done?). Given a sufficiently large flood event, almost all areas are potentially prone to flooding of some sort and to some degree. Three specific examples are discussed in this paper, where the brief is largely the same (i.e. fix the flooding), but the execution has been different. All three have been completed and deemed successful, and the content of this paper is aimed at showcasing a range of approaches. This includes identification of "the flood problem", determination of approaches to rectifying the problem (the "fixes") and different ways to measure the degree of success achieved.},
